Hello and welcome to the very first blog post on my personal site!

Most of my writing covers Japanese animation, comics, video games, and related pop culture, and appears in pop culture outlets like [Ani-Gamers](https://anigamers.com), [Otaku USA Magazine](https://otakuusamagazine.com), and [Anime News Network](https://animenewsnetwork.com). On very rare occasions, however, I actually write about the other half of my job: web design and development.

[My first post on the subject](https://medium.com/@vamptvo/pixels-vs-ems-users-do-change-font-size-5cfb20831773) was published on Medium, but considering Medium‘s accessibility and usability problems, I’d like to host my future web dev writing somewhere I can guarantee will be a little more responsible. And for that, there’s nothing quite like a personal website.

So this blog will be my repository for any web dev writing that I produce during the course of my freelance work. I’ll still keep most — if not all — of my anime writing in other outlets, but who knows, I may occasionally drop in here with some pop culture thoughts that don’t fit in anywhere else.
